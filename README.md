## ‚ôæÔ∏è Mission & Identity
I wonder how a probe drifts in silence and how AI could become its second heartbeat.  
I turn this curiosity into reproducible projects and logs, even while still in high school.  

> *Trajectory may drift, but the mission continues. Failure is part of orbit. Persistence is thrust.*

## :satellite: Flagship Project ‚Äî Spacecraft AI Controller
A self-directed research project simulating **orbital propulsion systems controlled by AI**.

- Progressing from physics-driven expert baselines ‚Üí imitation learning ‚Üí reinforcement learning  
- Tasks include orbital transfers, thrust ignition, and impulse vs continuous propulsion  
- Stress tests under noisy inputs, partial faults, and long-duration runs  
- **Logs and records** treated as mission data, ensuring reproducibility  

This project produced my first reproducible orbital transfer simulation and a stabilized baseline, tested under different orbital conditions with results carefully logged.  
My long-term goal is to make these simulations reliable enough to inspire future real-world spacecraft control.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Tech Foundations
Every spacecraft needs a foundation. Alongside my main track, I explore supporting disciplines:

- :robot: Robotics and control experiments  
- :zap: Embedded systems with Arduino and sensors  
- :satellite: CubeSat structural modeling and CAD design  
- :video_game: Reinforcement learning from simple environments to orbital tasks

## :film_strip: Research Journey
For me, research is not just about results. It is about rhythm, resilience, and meaning.  

Daily commits are like signals from a distant probe, sometimes faint but proof of flight.  
Failures are not waste but data points, each bug like a drift that forces a corrective burn.  
Logs serve as navigation records, marking coordinates in a long orbit.  
Growth is spiral, not linear, always correcting, never still.  

Traditional drills and competitions drained me, but projects gave me persistence.  
I learned to treat failures as part of the system, not reasons to quit.  
Projects gave me a reason to keep moving forward. When I am exploring and creating, I can work all day without noticing time.  

> *Even if today‚Äôs trajectory is blank, the learning orbit still runs within me.*

## üåå Curiosity and Research Path
I have always been curious about the universe.  
What might have existed before the Big Bang?  
What lies in places no probe has ever reached?  

Each time a spacecraft falls silent, I feel a deep sadness, like a heartbeat lost in the dark.  
That sorrow also becomes motivation: to design controllers that survive longer, adapt better, and carry human curiosity farther.  

I do not chase every subject across engineering, AI, or astrophysics.  
I focus on the pieces that matter for my mission, combining them like modules of a spacecraft.

## :hourglass: Timeline
Here is my trajectory so far, still unfolding:

- :telescope: **Age 16** Looked up at the night sky and wrote my first orbital simulation code  
- üå± **Age 18** Built reproducible projects and logs, publishing them on GitHub as a growing research portfolio  
- 	:airplane: **Early 20s** Aim to deepen the most relevant knowledge across engineering, AI, and science for spacecraft control  
- :alien: **Age 30** Aim to see my controllers tested on real systems, helping spacecraft continue their mission beyond human reach 
- ‚ôæÔ∏è Beyond that The path is uncertain, but the mission will continue

## :thought_balloon: Reflection
I know these goals may look far beyond reach, but why not try to pursue what truly excites me?  

On the day I defined this project, I wrote my first orbital simulation code.  
In summer I updated daily; later perhaps weekly ‚Äî each log still counts. 
Each step matters, no matter how small.  

Unlike endless drills where I once gave up, these projects keep me alive.  
Even when I collapse at 2 a.m. over a bug, I continue.  
Because each small step reminds me that I still have a chance, and I can still chase my dream.  

The universe is silent. This is my ignition.
